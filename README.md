# NotesToRawSoundConverter

The file "output.wav" is the file produced by "convertNotesToWAV.cpp" (of course, the compiled version) from "notes.txt". And "output.mp3" is the file produced by LAME from "output.wav". The song in "notes.txt" is [The Town I Loved So Well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Town_I_Loved_So_Well), an anti-war song about a town that has been destroyed by war. I've made no attempt to make it compatible with older C++ compilers, you need a decent C++ compiler to run it or modify it to make it work on your compiler. Dev-C++ is not good enough.
